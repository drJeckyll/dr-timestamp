# dr-timestamp
Firefox extenstion which convert epoch datetime to normal date format and vice versa and decode timestamp directly from page selection

Since my beloving TimeStamp Converter addon is dead I'm in searching for replacement. And because I'm lazy to look at too many results which addons.mozilla.org is keen to represent (1 649 results for „unix timestamp“) I decide to combine two of them.

So all credits to:
Harsh Karn- Author of Epoch Converter (ver. 2.0.1) - https://addons.mozilla.org/bg/firefox/addon/epochconverter/
noir04 - Author of Timestamp Decoder (ver. 0.0.3) - https://addons.mozilla.org/bg/firefox/addon/timestamp-decoder/

Very little original work here. Most is just a css adjustments.
